title: "About Me"
---

Hi there, I'm Ineza, welcome to my portfolio. This is my corner of
the internet where you get to see what I've been working on and
writing about.

My journey into web development started at the onset of the pandemic.
With so much time on my hands, the help of sites like FreeCodeCamp and friends I met online
I slowly grew my skills in JavaScript. I later joined the [Andela Technical
Leadership program](https://andela.com/andela-technical-leadership-program-rwanda)
where I got a chance to broaden my knowledge on Full Stack Development.

After graduating from the program I dabbled in Open source contributions
and technical writing which this website is a result of. I enjoy the whole
aspect of breaking down complex concepts and sharing the knowledge with others.
I hope this website continues to be that medium.

Away from code you'll probably find me baking banana bread or taking a long walk
by the Marina. I also volunteer at my local church in the Media Department
where I take on the responsibilities of maintaining our livestreams and building the church's website.

I'm currently working with some amazing folks ❤️ at [Relevant Bits](https://relevantbits.com/)
as a Full Stack Developer.
