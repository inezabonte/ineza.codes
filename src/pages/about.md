# About Me

Howdy, Ineza here, welcome to my corner of the internet where you get
to see what I've been working on and writing about.

I sometimes dabble in Open source contributions and technical writing which
this website is a result of. I enjoy the whole aspect of breaking down complex
concepts and sharing the knowledge with others. I hope this website continues
to be a medium for that and inspire others to do the same.

Away from code you'll probably find me baking banana bread or taking a long walk
by the Marina. I also serve at my local church in the Media Department
where I take on the responsibilities of maintaining our livestreams and building the church's website.

I work full time with some amazing folks over at [Relevant Bits](https://relevantbits.com/)
as a Full Stack Developer.
