### What are Open Graph meta tags?
[Open Graph](~https://ogp.me/~) is an internet protocol that was developed by Facebook 
back in 2010. It allows you to control what is displayed when the url of your page
is shared on social media networks like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.

### Basics of Open Graph 
The four basic properties used are:
- `og:title` - The title of the content on the page
- `og:description` - A description of the content on the page you are sharing
- `og:image` - An image url which will be used to represent your content
- `og:url` - The url of the current page
- `og:type` - The type of page you are describing e.g. article, website

> Tip: The minimum recommended dimensions for images are 1200 x 630   
> for optimal clarity across different platforms and devices.  

### Usage

Open Graph meta tags are usually placed in the `<head>` section of a website.
They are identified by the prefix  `og:` which is in the `property` attribute of a meta tag accompanied by the `content` attribute with a value.

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="TailwindCSS setup tutorial" />
<meta property="og:type" content="article" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://url-of-currentpage.com" />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://url-of-image.png" />
<meta property="og:description" content="A description about your content"/>

```

### Why should we use open graph tags?

Their purpose is to make your content eye-catching at the same time providing an
overview of the content the user should expect when they visit the url. This can help to
grow your brand by increasing visibility.

### Additional Social Media tags

Some social media sites like twitter have their own open graph tags that help
to customize the look of the content shared within their ecosystem.

For instance Twitter has a `twitter:card` property which can be used to
specify the type of card twitter uses to display your content. It takes the following
values;
- `summary`
- `summary_large_image`
- `app`
- `player`

It also has the `twitter:creator` property which can be used to specify
the username of the content creator/author

Here is a [link](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/getting-started) to the documentation with more details.

### Testing Open Graph tags

There are tools available that can help you test your url, to know
whether the Open Tags are working and also get a preview of how they 
will look once posted on social media.
